# Proxmox. Beginning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 1. Introduction 

Proxmox VE is a platform to run virtual machines and containers. It is
based on Debian Linux, and completely open source. For maximum
flexibility, we implemented two virtualization technologies -
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and container-based virtualization
(LXC).

One main design goal was to make administration as easy as possible. You
can use Proxmox VE on a single node, or assemble a cluster of many
nodes. All management tasks can be done using our web-based management
interface, and even a novice user can setup and install Proxmox VE
within minutes.

# 1.1. Central Management

While many people start with a single node, Proxmox VE can scale out to
a large set of clustered nodes. The cluster stack is fully integrated
and ships with the default installation.

[ Unique Multi-Master Design ]
:   The integrated web-based management interface gives you a clean
    overview of all your KVM guests and Linux containers and even of
    your whole cluster. You can easily manage your VMs and containers,
    storage or cluster from the GUI. There is no need to install a
    separate, complex, and pricey management server.

[ Proxmox Cluster File System (pmxcfs) ]

:   Proxmox VE uses the unique Proxmox Cluster file system (pmxcfs), a
    database-driven file system for storing configuration files. This
    enables you to store the configuration of thousands of virtual
    machines. By using corosync, these files are replicated in real time
    on all cluster nodes. The file system stores all data inside a
    persistent database on disk, nonetheless, a copy of the data resides
    in RAM which provides a maximum storage size of 30MB - more than
    enough for thousands of VMs.

    Proxmox VE is the only virtualization platform using this unique
    cluster file system.

[ Web-based Management Interface ]
:   Proxmox VE is simple to use. Management tasks can be done via the
    included web based management interface - there is no need to
    install a separate management tool or any additional management node
    with huge databases. The multi-master tool allows you to manage your
    whole cluster from any node of your cluster. The central web-based
    management - based on the JavaScript Framework (ExtJS) - empowers
    you to control all functionalities from the GUI and overview history
    and syslogs of each single node. This includes running backup or
    restore jobs, live-migration or HA triggered activities.

[ Command Line ]
:   For advanced users who are used to the comfort of the Unix shell or
    Windows Powershell, Proxmox VE provides a command-line interface to
    manage all the components of your virtual environment. This
    command-line interface has intelligent tab completion and full
    documentation in the form of UNIX man pages.

[ REST API ]
:   Proxmox VE uses a RESTful API. We choose JSON as primary data
    format, and the whole API is formally defined using JSON Schema.
    This enables fast and easy integration for third party management
    tools like custom hosting environments.

[ Role-based Administration ]
:   You can define granular access for all objects (like VMs, storages,
    nodes, etc.) by using the role based user- and permission
    management. This allows you to define privileges and helps you to
    control access to objects. This concept is also known as access
    control lists: Each permission specifies a subject (a user or group)
    and a role (set of privileges) on a specific path.

[ Authentication Realms ]
:   Proxmox VE supports multiple authentication sources like Microsoft
    Active Directory, LDAP, Linux PAM standard authentication or the
    built-in Proxmox VE authentication server.

# 1.2. Flexible Storage

The Proxmox VE storage model is very flexible. Virtual machine images
can either be stored on one or several local storages or on shared
storage like NFS and on SAN. There are no limits, you may configure as
many storage definitions as you like. You can use all storage
technologies available for Debian Linux.

One major benefit of storing VMs on shared storage is the ability to
live-migrate running machines without any downtime, as all nodes in the
cluster have direct access to VM disk images.

We currently support the following Network storage types:

-   LVM Group (network backing with iSCSI targets)
-   iSCSI target
-   NFS Share
-   CIFS Share
-   Ceph RBD
-   Directly use iSCSI LUNs
-   GlusterFS

Local storage types supported are:

-   LVM Group (local backing devices like block devices, FC devices,
    DRBD, etc.)
-   Directory (storage on existing filesystem)
-   ZFS

# 1.3. Integrated Backup and Restore

The integrated backup tool (`vzdump`{.literal}) creates consistent
snapshots of running Containers and KVM guests. It basically creates an
archive of the VM or CT data which includes the VM/CT configuration
files.

KVM live backup works for all storage types including VM images on NFS,
CIFS, iSCSI LUN, Ceph RBD. The new backup format is optimized for
storing VM backups fast and effective (sparse files, out of order data,
minimized I/O).

# 1.4. High Availability Cluster 

A multi-node Proxmox VE HA Cluster enables the definition of highly
available virtual servers. The Proxmox VE HA Cluster is based on proven
Linux HA technologies, providing stable and reliable HA services.

# 1.5. Flexible Networking

Proxmox VE uses a bridged networking model. All VMs can share one bridge
as if virtual network cables from each guest were all plugged into the
same switch. For connecting VMs to the outside world, bridges are
attached to physical network cards and assigned a TCP/IP configuration.

For further flexibility, VLANs (IEEE 802.1q) and network
bonding/aggregation are possible. In this way it is possible to build
complex, flexible virtual networks for the Proxmox VE hosts, leveraging
the full power of the Linux network stack.

# 1.6. Integrated Firewall

The integrated firewall allows you to filter network packets on any VM
or Container interface. Common sets of firewall rules can be grouped
into "security groups".

# 1.7. Hyper-converged Infrastructure 

Proxmox VE is a virtualization platform that tightly integrates compute,
storage and networking resources, manages highly available clusters,
backup/restore as well as disaster recovery. All components are
software-defined and compatible with one another.

Therefore it is possible to administrate them like a single system via
the centralized web management interface. These capabilities make
Proxmox VE an ideal choice to deploy and manage an open source
[hyper-converged
infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure){.ulink}.

## 1.7.1. Benefits of a Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI) with Proxmox VE

A hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) is especially useful for
deployments in which a high infrastructure demand meets a low
administration budget, for distributed setups such as remote and branch
office environments or for virtual private and public clouds.

HCI provides the following advantages:

-   Scalability: seamless expansion of compute, network and storage
    devices (i.e. scale up servers and storage quickly and independently
    from each other).
-   Low cost: Proxmox VE is open source and integrates all components
    you need such as compute, storage, networking, backup, and
    management center. It can replace an expensive compute/storage
    infrastructure.
-   Data protection and efficiency: services such as backup and disaster
    recovery are integrated.
-   Simplicity: easy configuration and centralized administration.
-   Open Source: No vendor lock-in.

## 1.7.2. Hyper-Converged Infrastructure: Storage

Proxmox VE has tightly integrated support for deploying a
hyper-converged storage infrastructure. You can, for example, deploy and
manage the following two storage technologies by using the web interface
only:

-   [**Ceph**]: a both self-healing and self-managing shared,
    reliable and highly scalable storage system. Checkout [how to manage
    Ceph services on Proxmox VE
    nodes]
-   [**ZFS**]{.strong}: a combined file system and logical volume
    manager with extensive protection against data corruption, various
    RAID modes, fast and cheap snapshots - among other features. Find
    out [how to leverage the power of ZFS on Proxmox VE
    nodes]

Besides above, Proxmox VE has support to integrate a wide range of
additional storage technologies. You can find out about them in the
[Storage Manager
chapter](#ch07.html "Chapter 7. Proxmox VE Storage"){.link}.

# 1.11. Project History

The project started in 2007, followed by a first stable version in 2008.
At the time we used OpenVZ for containers, and QEMU with KVM for virtual
machines. The clustering features were limited, and the user interface
was simple (server generated web page).

But we quickly developed new features using the
[Corosync] cluster stack,
and the introduction of the new Proxmox cluster file system (pmxcfs) was
a big step forward, because it completely hides the cluster complexity
from the user. Managing a cluster of 16 nodes is as simple as managing a
single node.

The introduction of our new REST API, with a complete declarative
specification written in JSON-Schema, enabled other people to integrate
Proxmox VE into their infrastructure, and made it easy to provide
additional services.

Also, the new REST API made it possible to replace the original user
interface with a modern client side single-page application using
JavaScript. We also replaced the old Java based VNC console code with
[noVNC]. So you only need a web
browser to manage your VMs.

The support for various storage types is another big task. Notably,
Proxmox VE was the first distribution to ship [ZFS on
Linux] by default in 2014. Another
milestone was the ability to run and manage
[Ceph] storage on the hypervisor nodes. Such
setups are extremely cost effective.

When our project started we were among the first companies providing
commercial support for KVM. The KVM project itself continuously evolved,
and is now a widely used hypervisor. New features arrive with each
release. We developed the KVM live backup feature, which makes it
possible to create snapshot backups on any storage type.

The most notable change with version 4.0 was the move from OpenVZ to
[LXC]. Containers are now deeply
integrated, and they can use the same storage and network features as
virtual machines. At the same time we introduced the easy-to-use [High
Availability (HA)
manager], simplifying
the configuration and management of highly available setups.

During the development of Proxmox VE 5 the asynchronous [storage
replication] as well
as automated [certificate
management] using
ACME/Let's Encrypt were introduced, among many other features.

The [Software Defined Network
(SDN)] stack
was developed in cooperation with our community. It was integrated into
the web interface as an experimental feature in version 6.2, simplifying
the management of sophisticated network configurations. Since version
8.1, the SDN integration is fully supported and installed by default.

2020 marked the release of a new project, the [Proxmox Backup
Server],
written in the Rust programming language. Proxmox Backup Server is
deeply integrated with Proxmox VE and significantly improves backup
capabilities by implementing incremental backups, deduplication, and
much more.

Another new tool, the [Proxmox Offline
Mirror], was released in 2022, enabling
subscriptions for systems which have no connection to the public
internet.

The highly requested dark theme for the web interface was introduced in
2023. Later that year, version 8.0 integrated access to the Ceph
enterprise repository. Now access to the most stable Ceph repository
comes with any Proxmox VE subscription.

Automated and unattended installation for the official [ISO
installer] was introduced in version 8.2, significantly simplifying large
deployments of Proxmox VE.

With the [import
wizard], equally introduced in version 8.2, users can easily and efficiently
migrate guests directly from other hypervisors like VMware ESXi
[^\[1\]^].
Additionally, archives in Open Virtualization Format (OVF/OVA) can now
be directly imported from file-based storages in the web interface.
